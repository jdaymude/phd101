.. On purpose:

   What must be different after this material is read?

   - Individuals considering pursuing a PhD (in computer science) will understand what a PhD is/isn't, enhancing their discernment.
   - Junior PhD students will have a set of tools, references, and examples to jumpstart their research and writing workflows.
   - PhD students will be able to navigate opaque academic processes and their various roles.


.. On audience:

   - "Specialists" are senior graduate students, postdocs, and established faculty&mdash;especially those from within mathematics and computer science.
   - "Nonspecialists" include prospective/junior graduate students, especially those from outside mathematics and computer science, and individuals who are curious about PhDs but have no current intention of pursuing one. This category technically includes everyone else as well, though their likelihood of reading this material is low.
   - "Primary readers", in this case, overlap heavily with the defined parts of the above two categories. The emphasis on "secondary readers" for this project is about how relevant information will be later in time and to those who just stumble across it.

   It's worth identifying what is specific to computer science theory vs. computer science generally vs. STEM vs. any PhD. Be conservative but hopeful in what's being recommended here.

.. tip::

   Global statements should always follow the following structure:

   * (optional) Context: why the need is pressing/important
   * Need: why something needs to be done at all
   * Task: what was undertaken to address the need
   * Object: what the present document does/covers
   * Findings: what the work done yielded or revealed
   * Conclusion: what the findings mean for the audience
   * (optional) Perspectives: what the future holds, beyond this work

.. tip::

   Each workflow/process we discuss has three components:

   1. We always start with the *problem/task* the workflow performs.
   2. Then we identify *principles* of good solutions.
   3. We conclude with possible software *solutions* for the problem/task that adhere to our desired principles.

   At the highest level of each workflow, the intro should state (1) what you'll get by following the workflow, and (2) any preliminaries/account setup/etc. you need first.


Nice quote:

Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me.
All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good
taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff,
it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but
it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still
killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people
never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do
interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work
doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go
through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this
phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do
is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you
will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that
you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your
ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone
I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile.
You’ve just gotta fight your way through.
