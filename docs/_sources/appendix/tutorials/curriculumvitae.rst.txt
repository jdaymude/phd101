Maintaining an academic CV
==========================

Task: collecting items, writing, and formatting a CV.

Principles: completeness, readability, easy maintenance.

Software Solution(s): LaTeX + CV theme + BibTeX. Certain customizations around auto-generated BibTeX lists of publications, presentations, and poster lists using multibib and nocite. Link to Zotero for "My Publications".
