.. admonition:: TODO

   One paragraph "about this guide".

   What must be different after this material is read?

   - Individuals considering pursuing a PhD (in computer science) will understand what a PhD is/isn't, enhancing their discernment.
   - Junior PhD students will have a set of tools, references, and examples to jumpstart their research and writing workflows.
   - PhD students will be able to navigate opaque academic processes and their various roles.


Who this guide is for
---------------------

.. admonition:: TODO

   One paragraph "who this is for".
   Some prior notes:

   - "Specialists" are senior graduate students, postdocs, and established faculty&mdash;especially those from within mathematics and computer science.
   - "Nonspecialists" include prospective/junior graduate students, especially those from outside mathematics and computer science, and individuals who are curious about PhDs but have no current intention of pursuing one. This category technically includes everyone else as well, though their likelihood of reading this material is low.
   - "Primary readers", in this case, overlap heavily with the defined parts of the above two categories. The emphasis on "secondary readers" for this project is about how relevant information will be later in time and to those who just stumble across it.

   It's worth identifying what is specific to computer science theory vs. computer science generally vs. STEM vs. any PhD. Be conservative but hopeful in what's being recommended here.


About the author
----------------

.. admonition:: TODO

   One paragraph "about the author", functioning partially as a disclaimer.


Other notes to be removed later
-------------------------------

.. tip::

   Global statements should always follow the following structure:

   * (optional) Context: why the need is pressing/important
   * Need: why something needs to be done at all
   * Task: what was undertaken to address the need
   * Object: what the present document does/covers
   * Findings: what the work done yielded or revealed
   * Conclusion: what the findings mean for the audience
   * (optional) Perspectives: what the future holds, beyond this work

.. tip::

   Each workflow/process we discuss has three components:

   1. We always start with the *problem/task* the workflow performs.
   2. Then we identify *principles* of good solutions.
   3. We conclude with possible software *solutions* for the problem/task that adhere to our desired principles.

   At the highest level of each workflow, the intro should state (1) what you'll get by following the workflow, and (2) any preliminaries/account setup/etc. you need first.
