Identifying a publication venue

.. admonition:: TODO

   This matters at this point in the process because (a) it determines the audience, (b) it may determine a deadline, and (c) it may affect length limitations.

   TODO: If it doesn't fit well anywhere else, this may be a good place to talk about tiers of conferences/journals, how to figure that out, academic "communities", and example conferences and journals are for my lab areas specifically.

   Explain the need to track venue pairs for deadlines, as there are a lot of them. Can discuss schema, but maybe not systems (I'm not terribly happy with the Trello or Airtable solutions I have so far).
