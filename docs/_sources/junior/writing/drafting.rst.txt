   Read Jean-luc's chapter on drafting written documents.

   This is where we need to talk about Overleaf vs. git vs. etc. for managing manuscripts.

   Deep Dive: LaTeX/BibTeX lessons and best practices.

   Draft the manuscript in a basic 'article' document class. In the first draft, focus on *clarity* and *accuracy*. Then revise a second draft focused on *conciseness*. If it's been some time between the initial literature search and this point in time, check the literature again and integrate anything important before moving on to revisions.
