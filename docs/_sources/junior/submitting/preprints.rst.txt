Registering preprints and digital artefacts
===========================================

.. admonition:: TODO

   We use LaTeX to easily format and structure manuscripts.

   Discuss the main formats (article, ACM, Springer, IEEE, LIPIcs, etc.), where they're appropriate, and what to use for arXiv.
   - Discuss any idiosyncracies with corresponding LaTeX templates (always read the manual!).

   The arXiv version has looser length requirements, but should still tell a concise and compelling story.

   Should also address the reproducibility crises with digital artefacts.
