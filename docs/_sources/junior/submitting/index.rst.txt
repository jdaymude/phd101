Submitting research manuscripts
===============================

   preprints
   conferences
   journals

Discuss submission to digital repositories (arXiv, SocArXiv, biorXiv), conferences (EasyChair, HotCRP), and journals (usually Editorial Manager).

Give a brief overview of what's happening in review for conferences and journals, but leave the details to the reviewing workflow (link to it). Estimate the time for reviews (conferences will tell you a decisions date, journals won't). Talk about reasonable times to reach out to the editor for signs of life.

Don't stress or worry or even think hard about your manuscript until decisions. Take a break. Work on other things.
