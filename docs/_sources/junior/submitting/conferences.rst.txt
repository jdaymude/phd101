Submitting to conferences
=========================

We use LaTeX to easily format and structure manuscripts.

Discuss the main formats (article, ACM, Springer, IEEE, LIPIcs, etc.) and where they're appropriate.
- Discuss any idiosyncracies with corresponding LaTeX templates (always read the manual!).

"Formatting" for our purposes may also involve cutting the paper down to size if length limitations apply.
