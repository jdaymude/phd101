Refining the argument
=====================

Put the foreword and summary together.
Present the flow of experiments/proofs/etc. to various audiences (lab meetings, colleagues, collaborators, etc.) and see if they're convinced.
This will be a cycle of going back and reevaluating things, most likely.

Know how to prune the tree.
