What is a PhD?

Before we can discern whether to pursue a PhD or learn how best to navigate it, we must first understand what it is.
Beyond its literal definition as an *academic degree*, I conceptualize a PhD as an *apprenticeship in creating, validating, and communicating ideas*.
This definition differentiates the PhD from a purely information-based degree (like a Bachelor's), emphasizes the PhD's central relationship (advisorâ€“advisee), and identifies the core purpose of a PhD (participation in the economy of ideas).


A PhD as an academic degree
---------------------------

At its most literal, a `Doctor of Philosophy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy>`_ (typically abbreviated as PhD, Ph.D., or DPhil) is a doctorate degree awarded at the highest level of academic achievement.
