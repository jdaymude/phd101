   Discuss electronic communication (email & messaging), advisor meetings (how to prepare, agendas, etc.), and group presentations.

Task: effective electronic communication.

Principles: efficiency, clarity, availability, organization, persistence.

Software Solution(s):

- Email: Focus is on features as opposed to a single client/provider: tags vs. folders, signatures, clear communication (see Jean-luc), archive/delete. Discuss pros/cons of using institutional email. Can mention the "just use email" project, though I'm in some disagreement there.
- Pairwise messaging: Signal > Whatsapp > iMessage and other platform-specific issues.
- Group messaging: Zulip > Discord ~ Slack > Teams.
- Video conferencing: Zoom is defacto, Teams is okay. Various privacy-focused/open-source alternatives exist.
