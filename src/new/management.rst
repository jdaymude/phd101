Managing projects and time

   **NOTE**: while somewhat disjoint, this and project management seem related to communicating digitally in that they're all loosely coupled, relating to the communication/connectivity parts of research and courses.

   Principles:

   Software Solution(s):
   - Calendar: Again focus on features instead of apps: tags/categorization, invitation etiquette, good naming, time zone checking, bonus for availability.
   - Project Tracking: Kanban boards, e.g., Trello/Airtable/MS Planner/open source alternative.


Calendars
---------

.. admonition:: Notes

   I need my calendar(s) to do the following, in order of priority:

   #. Do basic calendar things. Make events, invite people to events, support locations, etc.
   #. Allow me to sufficiently organize (visually) what various event types are.
   #. Make things visually appealing, especially in an interface.
   #. Give me full control over my events (renaming, etc.) even when I'm not the owner.
   #. Allow Annie to see my full calendar (or at least the personal parts).
   #. Allow coworkers (especially students) to see my "busy" times vs. availability.
   #. Use ASU-specific locations in events.

   My current solution is to do a two-way sync between my personal Google calendar and my work Exchange/Outlook calendar.
   I will do all editing from the Google Calendar client, but will assign events to calendars based on the personal/work split.
   Google Calendar does everything I want it to do for basic functionality, visual categorization, good interface, full control, and family sharing.
   Exchange/Outlook supports syncing external calendars while still showing them to coworkers as "busy".
   The only thing I lose out on in this workflow is ASU-specific locations, which if really needed I can do from the Exchange/Outlook client.

   The above *doesn't* work because, evidently, ASU has Exchange set up so that its calendars can't be edited from outside the organization.
   This means that I can only create or edit events on the Exchange calendar via the Exchange client.
   The best alternative I can think of is a two-way sync with any client for viewing but multiple clients for editing.
   What a pain in the ass.
   In a way, this sort of ended up mirroring what I'm currently doing for email, so maybe it won't be so so awful.
